<h1>Simple idea</h1>

<p>
  tldr; Invest now to do more tomorrow or do more today.
  You can invest time in becoming more productive now or instead use that time to perform work.
  Lets use a simple model to explore this trade-off.
  You have a base productivity \(w_0\). You can invest \(C_p\) today to be \(p_r\) more productive tomorrow.
  mathematically:
  \[ w_{t+1} = w_t.(1 + p_r) \]
  or
  \[ w_{t+1} = w_0.(1 + p_r)^t \]

  so over period t the amount of work done is:

  \[ TW_{t} = \sum_{j=0}^{j=t}w_0.(1 + p_r)^j - C_p.t \]

  the term \(C_p.t\) represents the investment in time to get a productivity increase p_r in the next period.

  Lets visualize how these values evolve over time:
